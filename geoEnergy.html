    <h1>what is geothermal energy?</h1>
 <!--adding text into the white container-->
           <p>Geothermal energy is a type of renewable energy<br> taken from the Earthâ€™s core. It comes from heat <br>generated during the original formation of the planet<br> and the radioactive decay of materials. This thermal energy <br>is stored in rocks and fluids in the centre of the earth</p></li>

               Geothermal Energy - Geyser EruptingThe difference<br> between the temperature in the earthâ€™s core<br> and the surface drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy <br>from the centre to the exterior of the planet.</p></li>
                
                
              <p> High temperatures of over 4000Â°C cause some of <br>the rock in the centre of the Earth to melt and<br> form hot molten rocks called magma. These heats also cause the<br> mantle to behave plastically and portions of it to convect<br>upwards, since it is lighter than the surrounding rock. </p></li>

                <h1> how is it Used?</h1>It has been used in some countries<br>
                 for thousands of yearsfor cooking and in heating <br>
                 systems. The underground geothermal reservoirs of <br>
                 steam and heated water can be used for electricity<br></p>

                  <p>generation and other heating and cooling applications.<br>
                  One example of heating and cooling at a constant temperature<br>
                   is the installation of a geothermal heat pump about 10 feet<br>
                    underground. These pipes are filled with water or an <br>
                    antifreeze solution.  The water is pumped around the <br></p>

                    <p>closed loop of pipes. These ground source heat pump systems<br>
                     help to cool buildings in summer and maintain warmth in summer.<br>
                      This occurs by absorbing the earthâ€™s heat as the water and <br></p>
                      <p>steam circulates back into the building.Geothermal water<br>
                       has been used to help grow plants in greenhouses, for<br>
                        district heating in homes and businesses. It can also <br>
                        be piped under roads to melt snow.

              <h1>How is Geothermal Energy Produced?</h1>
              <p>
                Wells of up to a mile deep or more are drilled into underground <br>
                reservoirs to tap into the geothermal resources. These resources can<br>
                 be exploited from naturally occurring heat, rock and water permeability<br>
                  or through enhanced geothermal systems, which enhance or create <br>
                  geothermal resources through a process called hydraulic stimulation.<br>
                   These geothermal resources, whether natural or enhanced, drive turbines<br>
                    linked to electricity generators.</p>

                    <p>The first recorded instance of geothermal heat being used for<br>
                    producing electricity was in Larderello, Italy in 1904. Yet, geothermal<br>
                      heat has been used for bathing since the Palaeolithic Age. Monkeys in Japan <br>
                      have also been shown to use heated water from hot springs to keep warm during<br>
                      winter months in mountainous regions.
