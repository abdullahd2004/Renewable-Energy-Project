        <h1>HOW DO WE GET ENERGY FROM WATER?</h1>
        <p>Hydropower, or hydroelectric power, is a renewable source of energy that generates<br>
             power by using a dam or diversion structure to alter the natural flow of a river or<br>
              other body of water. Hydropower relies on the endless, constantly recharging system <br>
              of the water cycle to produce electricity, using a fuelâ€”waterâ€”that is not reduced or<br>
               eliminated in the process. There are many types of hydropower facilities, though they<br>
                are all powered by the kinetic energy of flowing water as it moves downstream. Hydropower<br>
                 utilizes turbines and generators to convert that kinetic energy into electricity, which<br> is then fed into the electrical grid to power homes, businesses, and industries.

                 <br> <h1>HOW EXACTLY IS ELECTRICITY GENERATED AT HYDROPOWER PLANTS?</h1>
                 <p>Because hydropower uses water to generate electricity, plants are usually located on <br>
                    or near a water source. The energy available from the moving water depends on both the <br>
                    volume of the water flow and the change in elevationâ€”also known as the headâ€”from one point<br>
                     to another. The greater the flow and the higher the head, the more the electricity that<br>
                      can be generated. At the plant level, water flows through a pipeâ€”also known as a <br>
                      penstockâ€”and then spins the blades in a turbine, which, in turn, spins a generator<br>
                       that ultimately produces electricity. Most conventional hydroelectric facilities<br>
                        operate this way, including run-of-the-river systems and pumped storage systems.</p>
