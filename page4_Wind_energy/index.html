        <h1>Wind Turbines</h1>
       <p>Once called windmills, the technology used to harness the power of wind<br>
         has advanced significantly over the past ten years, with the United States <br>
         increasing its wind power capacity 30% year over year. Wind turbines, as they<br>
          are now called, collect and convert the kinetic energy that wind produces <br>
          into electricity to help power the grid.

        Wind energy is actually a byproduct of the sun. The sunâ€™s uneven heating of the<br>
         atmosphere, the earthâ€™s irregular surfaces (mountains and valleys), and the planet's<br>
          revolution around the sun all combine to create wind. Since wind is in plentiful<br>
           supply, itâ€™s a sustainable resource for as long as the sunâ€™s rays heat the planet.<br>
        
        In addition, because wind power is a growing industry, itâ€™s adding jobs to communities<br>
         around the country. Currently, there are utility-scale wind plants in 41 states that have<br>
          created more than 100,000 jobs for Americans.
        
        Learn more about the wind industry here, from how a wind turbine works, to the new and<br>
         exciting research in the field of wind energy.</p>

            This aerial view of a wind turbine plant<br>
             shows how a group of wind turbines can make<br>
              electricity for the utility grid. The <br>
              electricity is sent through<br>
            transmission and distribution lines<br>
             to homes, businesses, schools, and so<br>
              on.
