        <h1>solar energy facts</h1>
        <p>Solar energy is the fastest growing and most affordable <br>
             source of new electricity in America. As the cost of<br>
              solar energy systems dropped significantly, more <br>
              Americans and businesses have taken advantage of clean energy. <br>

    <h1>How does solar power work? </h1>
    <p>Solar power works by converting energy from the sun into power.<br>
         There are two forms of energy generated from the sun for our <br>
         use â€“ electricity and heat.<br>

        Both are generated through the use of solar panels, which range<br> 
        in size from residential rooftops to â€˜solar farmsâ€™ stretching <br>
        over acres of rural land.
        </p>


       <h1>How exactly is electricity from solar energy produced?</h1>
       <p>Solar panels are usually made from silicon, or another semiconductor<br>
         material installed in a metal panel frame with a glass casing. When this<br>
          material is exposed to photons of sunlight (very small packets of <br>
          energy) it releases electrons and produces an electric charge.<br></p>

       <p>This PV charge creates an electric current (specifically, direct <br>
        current or DC), which is captured by the wiring in solar panels. <br>
        This DC electricity is then converted to alternating current (AC)<br>
         by an inverter. AC is the type of electrical current used when you <br>
         plug appliances into normal wall sockets.</p>
